# Clarification of technical requirements with NIX.cz
To install the MEET application we need to know:
- Information about the server where the application is to be installed
- The domain name that will be used and at the same time prepare DNS A and AAAA records pointing to the server with the application
- Which SMTP server will be used
     - Account credentials on your SMTP server for sending messages from an application under your domain
     - If you do not have your own working SMTP server, it is possible to arrange for all emails from us to be sent from the address meet@nix.cz
