# Basic configuration of the MEET application

To properly install the MEET application, the following procedure must be followed:
1) [Create Event](#_1)
2) [Create Subevents](#_2) *(optional)*
3) [Create time slots](#_3)
4) [Create locations (tables)](#_4)
5) [Edit Email Templates](#_5) *(optional)*
6) [Import User](#_6)
7) [Publish Event and send email registrations to users](#_7)
<br />

> **Important**
> ‚ö†Ô∏è**All automatic sending of emails is disabled by default** to prevent unwanted sending of messages when testing the API or studying the administration of the application.
>
>**Email messages to be sent are accumulated in the "Queued Mails" module**, from here the queue can be checked before turning on automatic sending. At the same time, it is possible to manually send or delete selected emails.

## Create Event <a id='_1'></a>

> **Important**
> **Do not use the application at all without an established event!**

You can create an event with the "Add" button directly from the Dashboard:

![](../_data/screenshots/0002.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![](../_data/screenshots/dark/0002.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")


or via the "Add Event" button from the "Events" module

![](../_data/screenshots/0003.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![](../_data/screenshots/dark/0003.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")

## Fill in the information about the Event in the form

<table>
<tr>
<td>

- **Name** - name of the Event

- **Description** - a short description, a short paragraph about the focus of the Event is most often used here
- **Date start** - date and time when the Event starts *(when you click on the item, a calendar will appear with the option to choose)*
- **Date end** - date and time when the Event ends
- **Registration Ends** - The date until which registrations are allowed
- *Max Persons - currently unused*
- *Max per Company - currently unused*
- *External URL - currently unused*
- **Timezone** - time zone of the country in which the Event will take place
- **Status** - the state in which the planning of the event is *(when creating, leave "In preparation", once everything is set it is possible to switch to "Published")*
- **Mail Template From** - leave the option "Default template". Only if you would like to run the application with several Events at the same time and you needed to copy email templates from an earlier Event.

**Don't forget to save by clicking the "Save" button** in the right column next to the form
</td>
<td>

![](../_data/screenshots/0004.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![](../_data/screenshots/dark/0004.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")
</td>

</tr></table>
<br /><br /><br />

## 2) Create Subevents <a id='_2'></a>
Subevents are in the application in case you need to register participation in the main Event program
*(e.g. paid lecture, dinner, social evening, etc.)*. Users with "Staff" authorization can use QR codes for registration and an integrated reader to record participation.

You can create a Subevent from the Dashboard or via the "Add Event" button from the "Subevents" module
<br /><br /><br />

## 3) Create time slots <a id='_3'></a>
Time slots can be created in two ways:

- **Using a generator** - *(recommended)*
the generator is available in the "Events" module by clicking on the clock icon ![](../../_data/i-clock.svg)<br><br>
![](../_data/screenshots/0005.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![](../_data/screenshots/dark/0005.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")

> **Note**
> Slot and location generators are only available for events that have the status "In preparation"


- **Manually** in the "Locations" module, by clicking the "Add location" button in the upper right corner
<br /><br /><br />

## 4) Create locations <a id='_4'></a>
Locations, like [time slots](#_3), can be created in both ways.

To display the generator this time, the chair icon is used in the "Events" module ![](../../_data/i-chair.svg)
<br /><br /><br />

## 5) Edit email templates <a id='_5'></a>
> **Important**
> Please be very careful here, emailing can break if there is a syntax error in the templates syntax ‚ö†Ô∏è

If the default text in the email templates does not suit you and you need to edit the information sent, this is possible in the main navigation, the "Mail templates" item.

If you need to completely change the look of the main mailing template and have your own graphics in your emails, you need to create a new HTML template _BASE (only for experts), or contact us and we can arrange to create a "tailor-made" template.
<br /><br /><br />

## 6) Import user <a id='_6'></a>
To create users, we recommend using **[import via API](0004.md)**, which takes care of all the necessary bindings.

> **Note**
>It is of course possible to create users and registrations manually, but it is a more complicated process:
>- It is necessary to create a new user in the "Users" module, assign or create a new company in "Companies"
>- On the "System" tab in the user details, the Status needs to be changed from created to "Active" *(without this, the user would not be able to find it in the selection when creating a registration)*
>- Create user registration for a specific event

<br /><br />

## 7) Publish the Event and send email registrations to users <a id='_7'></a>
Congratulations on completing the basic setup! üéâü•≥

Now all that remains is to change the status of the upcoming event to "Published" in the "Events" module and thus publish it.

After that, it is possible to contact NIX.cz with information about the fact that everything is ready and arrange to start automatic sending of messages.
