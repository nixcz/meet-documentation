# Basic configuration of the MEET application

To properly install the MEET application, the following procedure must be followed:
1) [Create Event](#_1)
2) [Create Subevents](#_2) *(optional)*
3) [Create time slots](#_3)
4) [Create locations (tables)](#_4)
5) [Edit Email Templates](#_5) *(optional)*
6) [Import User](#_6)
7) [Publish Event and send email registrations to users](#_7)
<br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è**All automatic sending of emails is disabled by default** to prevent unwanted sending of messages when testing the API or studying the administration of the application.
>
>**Email messages to be sent are accumulated in the "Queued Mails" module**, from here the queue can be checked before turning on automatic sending. At the same time, it is possible to manually send or delete selected emails *(only users with "Superusers" permission can delete)*.

## Create Event <a id='_1'></a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do not use the application at all without an established event!**

You can create an event with the "Add" button directly from the Dashboard:

![Creating Event](../../_data/screenshots/0002.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Creating Event](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0002.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")


or via the "Add Event" button from the "Events" module

![Creating Event 2](../../_data/screenshots/0003.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Creating Event 2](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0003.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")

## ‚úèÔ∏è Fill in the information about the Event in the editing form

<table>
<tr>
<td>

- **Name** - name of the Event

- **Description** - a short description, a short paragraph about the focus of the Event is most often used here
- ‚ú®**Address** - Used when exporting in CSV calendar as meeting location
- **Date start** - date and time when the Event starts *(when you click on the item, a calendar will appear with the option to choose)*
- **Date end** - date and time when the Event ends
- **Registration Ends** - The date until which registrations are allowed
- üöß *Max Persons - currently unused*
- üöß *Max per Company - unused at the moment*
- üöß *External URL - unused at the moment*
- ‚ú® **Disable meet collisions** - If not set, the user can be invited to multiple meetings at once *(it is up to the user to confirm which one - default application behavior)*
- ‚ú® **Disable Custom Locations** - disabling the ability to create custom locations for events, users will be forced to choose only from predefined tables, without the ability to specify a location like "At the bar" etc.
- **Timezone** - time zone of the country in which the Event will take place
- **Status** - the state in which the planning of the event is *(when creating, leave "In preparation", once everything is set it is possible to switch to "Published")*
- **Mail Template From** - leave the option "Default template". Only if you want to run the application with several Events at once and you need to copy email templates from another Event.

**Don't forget to save by clicking the "Save" button** in the right column next to the form

<td>

![Event - Form](../../_data/screenshots/0004.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Event - Form](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0004.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")
</td>

</tr></table>
<br /><br /><br />

## 2) Create Subevents <a id='_2'></a>
Subevents are in the application in case you need to register participation in the main Event program
*(e.g. paid lecture, dinner, social evening, etc.)*. Users with "Hostess" authorization can use QR codes for registration and an integrated reader to record participation.

You can create a Subevent from the Dashboard or via the "Add Event" button from the "Subevents" module
<br /><br /><br />

## 3) Create time slots <a id='_3'></a>
Time slots can be created in two ways:

- **Using a generator** - *(recommended)*
the generator is available in the "Events" module by clicking on the clock icon ![Clock icon](../../_data/i-clock.svg)<br><br>
![Generators](../../_data/screenshots/0005.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Generators](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0005.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")

> [!NOTE]
> Slot and location generators are only available for events that have the status "In preparation" and can generate a maximum of 100 records per run.


- **Manually** in the "Locations" module, by clicking the "Add location" button in the upper right corner
<br /><br /><br />

## 4) Create locations <a id='_4'></a>
Locations, like [time slots](#_3), can be created in both ways.

To display the generator this time, the chair icon is used in the "Events" module![Chair icon](../../_data/i-chair.svg)
<br /><br /><br />

## 5) Edit email templates <a id='_5'></a>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please be very careful here, sending emails may break if there is a syntax error in the template syntax ‚ö†Ô∏è

If the default text in email templates is not suitable and you need to modify the information sent, it is possible to change it in the [Mail templates] (0009.md) module.

If you need to completely change the appearance of the main mailing template and have your own graphics in the emails, you must log in as a user with "Superusers" permission and create a new or change the existing HTML template _BASE *(only for experienced)*, or contact us and we can make an agreement to create a "custom" template.
<br /><br /><br />

## 6) Import user <a id='_6'></a>
To create users, we recommend using **[import form](0004a.md)** or **[import using API](0004b.md)**, which will take care of all the necessary bindings.

> [!NOTE]
>Users and registrations can of course be created manually, but this is a more complicated process:
>- It is necessary to create a new user in the "Users" module, assign or create a new company in "Companies"
>- On the "System" tab in the user details, the Status needs to be changed from created to "Active" *(without this, the user would not be able to find it in the selection when creating a registration)*
>- Create user registration for the event

<br /><br />

## 7) Publish the Event and send email registrations to users <a id='_7'></a>
Congratulations on completing the basic setup! üéâü•≥

Now all that remains is to change the status of the upcoming event to "Published" in the "Events" module and thus publish it.

After that, it is possible to contact NIX.cz with information that everything is ready and arrange to start automatic sending of messages *(You can also enable automatic sending of the message queue yourself by checking the "Enable periodic sending" checkbox in the [Global Configuration](0010.md) module, but we recommend that you let us know that the application is ready for deployment in production)*.
