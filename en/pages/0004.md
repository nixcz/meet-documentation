# Import users using the API
Even before you start trying to import users using the API, you need to generate an authorization token for the created Event in the "Tokens" module (the token has the following form:
```
Sample Token: 184cb07e-d4aa-4e05-bc0f-ccb612198179)
```

![Tokens](../../_data/screenshots/0006.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Tokens](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0006.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")

## Syntax to import user:
```bash
curl -X POST https://<URL>/api/registrations/import/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_GENERATED_BY_ADMIN>" -d '[{"firstName": "Joe", "lastName": "Doe", " company": "NIX.CZ", "mail": "joe.doe@example.com", "asn": 6881, "countryCode": "CZ"} ]'
```
> **Note**
> Importing a user will trigger an email with the template "EVENT_INVITE" to be sent to activate the tool.

### What exactly happens after the user import API is called?

- A new user record is created in the "Users" module and immediately set as active
- If the company has not yet appeared in the "Companies" module, it will be automatically created and a link will be created with the imported user
- Each new import of the same user ***(email is the primary key)*** will only update the existing one instead of creating a new one
- The token is used for event authentication and identification, if you want to register the same user for multiple Events, you must call the same API call with a different token
