<table>
<tr><td  width="300" style="vertical-align: top; padding: 0">

## Rozvržení importního formuláře

**(1) Public google sheet link** - 
- (1a) - Link to our sample google docs: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<span style="background: #ffff0040">17bPwNfXj-8bFfeRF5y91q5aZGs4bCA0eXkBrhS6bzSM</span>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17bPwNfXj-8bFfeRF5y91q5aZGs4bCA0eXkBrhS6bzSM)

- (1b) - 
Field for entering the ID of a public Google document *(from the sample URL, it is the part after spreadsheets/d/ in the format: 17bPwNfXj-8bFfeRF5y91q5aZGs4bCA0eXkBrhS6bzSM)* 
⚠️**Google document must be PUBLIC!** - For non-public Google documents, import is not allowed due to missing permissions 

- (1c) - A button that starts synchronization *(at the same time, the Google Sheet ID is saved to the browser's local storage, so the next time you import from the same source, you don't need to enter it again)*

**(2) CSV file upload section**
- (2a) - Area for Drag&drop of CSV file, at the same time you can click in the area to display a dialog for selecting a file from the device's local storage.

- (2b) - Specification and description of the CSV file format, what it must meet for the import to pass without errors
- (2c) - Sample CSV file + Download button
- (2d) - List of columns that can be used in the import file, by status

- <span style="border-radius: 10px; padding: 0px 8px; color: #fff; background: #dc3545; white-space: nowrap">Email - primary key</span> - Required column
- <span style="border-radius: 10px; padding: 0px 8px; color: #fff; background: #28a745; white-space: nowrap">User identification</span> - Can also be used to rename existing users
- <span style="border-radius: 10px; padding: 0px 8px; color: #fff; background: #6c757d; white-space: nowrap">Additional information</span>
- <span style="border-radius: 10px; padding: 0px 8px; color: #fff; background: #007bff; white-space: nowrap">Event registration status</span> - can take on values
    - NEW
    - SENT
    - CONFIRMED
    - REJECTED
    - CANCELED
    - DELETED

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Except for the primary key *(email)*, the event and subevent registration status, all data in the database is always overwritten with new values ​​from the import script. Registration statuses are written only once, on the first run *(this is to prevent unwanted overwriting of statuses already changed by users)*

**(3) Form function buttons**
- Start import - is disabled, it is activated only when a CSV file is selected or a Google Sheet ID is entered
- Close button to interrupt the import

### Import statuses for SubEvents
It is possible to import the status of registrations for individual SubEvents into the application at once, just add new columns to each record, the names of which must be identical to the names of the subevents for which the import is required.
The following statuses can be included:
- PENDING 
- CONFIRMED
- CANCELED

Sample:
> mail,Test Subevent1,Test Subevent2  
> joe@example.com,CONFIRMED,PENDING


## Next step: Analyze imported data
After sending the CSV file or Google sheet ID, the data will be checked. If the data is OK, the details will be displayed:

![Import details](../../_data/screenshots/0028.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Import details](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0028.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")


## Import form layout

<table>
<tr><td width="50%">
**(1) Information about the progress of the upcoming import** *(how many users, registrations and companies will be added by the import)*
- (1a) Indicates that the data file is OK and the import can be performed
- (1b) +4 users will be added *(Exists: 0 means that the file contained only new users, if the user was already in the database, the import script will ignore it and the Exists value would be different from 0 - according to the number of users found)*
- (1c) +4 new registrations
- (1d) +3 new companies
</td>
<td width="50%">

**(2) Detailed list of imported data**
- The first column contains numbered lines *(4) - is the total number of records in the file*
- The list contains all data that is in the data file

**(3) Function buttons**
- Start import - starts the import script itself with the supplied data
- Close button to interrupt the import

</td>

</tr></table>


If the CSV file contains incorrect columns or data that the import script cannot handle, an error message will be displayed.

![Import error](../../_data/screenshots/0029.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Import error](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0029.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")


You are then allowed to upload another file containing the correct columns and structure.

## Start import
After clicking the Start Import button, you need to wait a moment and as soon as the green message "Registrations imported" appears, the import is successfully completed.

> [!NOTE]
> When importing, you can also use a CSV file as a source file, which can be generated using the bulk action for registrations "Download list of registrations", this allows you to easily back up or elegantly transfer user registrations from one event to another.
