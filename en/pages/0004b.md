# Import users using the API
Even before you start trying to import users using the API, you need to generate an authorization token for the created Event in the "Tokens" module.
```
Sample Token: 184cb07e-d4aa-4e05-bc0f-ccb612198179
```

![Tokens](../../_data/screenshots/0006.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Tokens](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0006.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")

## Syntax to import user:
```bash
curl -X POST https://<URL>/api/registrations/import/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_GENERATED_BY_ADMIN>" -d '[{"firstName": "Joe", "lastName": "Doe", "company": "NIX.CZ", "mail": "joe.doe@example.com", "asn": 6881, "countryCode": "CZ"} ]'
```
### What exactly happens after the user import API is called?

> [!NOTE]
> Importing a user will trigger an email with the template "EVENT_INVITE" to be sent to activate the tool.

- A new user record is created in the "Users" module and immediately set as active

- If the company has not yet appeared in the "Companies" module, it will be automatically created and a link will be created with the imported user
- Each new import of the same user ***(email is the primary key)*** will only update the existing one instead of creating a new one
- The token is used for event authentication and identification, if you want to register the same user for multiple Events, you must call the same API call with a different token


## Syntax for unregistering
When canceling a registration, the procedure is the same as when importing, only instead of the POST method, you need to enter the DELETE method and in the data you only need to pass the user's email *(serving as the primary key)*
```bash
curl -X DELETE https://<URL>/api/registrations/import/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_GENERATED_BY_ADMIN>" -d '{"mail": "joe.doe@example.com"}'
```

### What exactly happens after calling the API for user import?
- User registration for the event will change to CANCELED
- User status will change to INACTIVE, they will no longer be able to log in to the application with this email
- Their password will be deleted *(in case it is necessary to reactivate the user, they will need to reset their password using the Forgotten password form)*
- If the user already has a meeting scheduled, the error HTTP_409_CONFLICT will be returned
- If everything runs smoothly, HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT will be returned
