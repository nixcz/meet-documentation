# Basic module layout and functionality
After clicking on a specific module from the main menu, üìÑ **list of records** *(except [Dashboard](0002.md))* is always displayed.

The application allows multiple Events to be run at the same time, the data in the modules are tied to a specific Event *(preferred event)*. So you need to always have it selected in the main menu.

![Preferred event](../../_data/screenshots/0014.png)

> [!NOTE]
>If the preferred event is not selected, some modules may not display data at all and a yellow warning will be displayed about this fact.

## üìÑ List of records

![List](../../_data/screenshots/0007.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![List](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0007.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

**(1) üì¶ Module Name**

**(2) Granular Navigation**

**(3) New record button**

**(4) üîç Filtering** record listing and **search field**.
Filtering is usually different for each module.

**(5a) üí° Mass actions + number of selected records** on which the action will be performed. Each module has its own bulk actions that can be performed on selected records. The only common action that can be used in most modules is deleting records.

*Example of mass actions for users:*

![Bulk Actions](../../_data/screenshots/0009.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Bulk Actions](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0009.png#gh-dark-mode-only)


**(5b) Selection of all** displayed records for bulk action.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When this checkbox is checked in the header of the listing, only the records on the current page are selected *(pagination is after 100 records)*.
If you would like to perform the action on all records, in addition to checking this checkbox, you also need to click on the link **Select all Users**
![Select all entries](../../_data/screenshots/0008.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Select all entries](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0008.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

**(5c) Selection of a specific entry** for a mass action

(6) **List of available records** after applying the filter and pagination

(7) **Total number of records** with the option to display all on one page.
> [!IMPORTANT]
>CAUTION: in the case of a large number of records, this operation may take a lot of time and computing power.

(8) **Paging** is displayed only if more than 100 records are stored

## Sorting the statement by columns
![Sorting records by column](../../_data/screenshots/0020.png#gh-light-mode-only)

Columns in the header of the listing table, which are blue, can be sorted by clicking:
- Descending ![Descending](../../_data/19.svg#gh-light-mode-only) ![Descending](../../_data/dark/19.svg#gh-dark- mode-only)
- Ascending ![Ascending](../../_data/20.svg#gh-light-mode-only) ![Ascending](../../_data/dark/20.svg#gh-dark- mode-only)

Sorting can be canceled by clicking on the cross icon ![Close](../../_data/21.svg#gh-light-mode-only) ![Close](../../_data/dark/21. svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

> [!NOTE]

## ‚úèÔ∏è Editing Form

![Edit form](../../_data/screenshots/0010.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Edit form](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0010.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

## **(1) üîñ Tabs** *(Tabs)*
In the case of modules, when the editing form is more extensive, it is divided into parts that you can switch between for clarity.

## **(2) Form** *(on the General tab)*
Form with basic user information

Form fields for entering dates allow, in addition to manual entry in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:II:SS, to insert a date using a calendar selection.

![Select data](../../_data/screenshots/0016.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Select data](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0016.png#gh-dark-mode-only)


Form items that contain a link to a record from another module have 4 additional icons for faster handling in the newly opened popup window.

## **(3) üíé Function buttons**
Here you can find all the options that can be done with the recording. Each module can have different buttons.

Basic buttons:

**Save** - Saves the record and returns in the module to list all records

**Delete** - Deletes the record *(but only if it does not appear anywhere, if it does, a list of conflicts that prevent deletion will be displayed)*

**Save and add another** - The record is saved and after saving, an empty form for adding another record is displayed

**Save and continue editing** - After saving the record, the detail of the saved record will be displayed


**History** - list of changes to the viewed record

> [!NOTE]
> On the following pages of the documentation, you will find detailed functions and features of the modules, as well as how they differ from the basics described on this page.
