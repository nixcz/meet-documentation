# Meeting Modules
These are core modules of the application, in which all the logic and behavior of arranging meetings, reserving tables, etc. is defined.

## 📄 List of records

![Events - Listing](../../_data/screenshots/0018.png#gh-light-mode-only "")
![Events - Listing](../../_data/screenshots/dark/0018.png#gh-dark-mode-only "")


**Status:**
- **In preparation** - with this status, the Event is not public, it is used for the setup period, to generate tables, time slots, etc.
- **Published** - Once the event switches to this status, everything will be published and users will see the option to register for the Event after logging in
- 🚧 *Ended* - *(Ended event not yet implemented, Event should only be in "readonly" mode, only for archival purposes)*
- **Deleted** - Deleted Event, it physically remains in the database, but is not displayed anywhere.

**Generators**
- ![Clock icon](../../_data/i-clock.svg) - Time slot generator
    
     Just enter **start and end date / time** + **slot length** in minutes. After saving, the generator automatically creates the necessary number of timeslots between these times.
- ![Chair Icon](../../_data/i-chair.svg) - Location Generator

     **Name:** Table name prefix

     **Start Number in name:** - The number from which the autoincrement of newly generated tables should start. The resulting shape will be, for example: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, etc.

     **Capacity**: The number of people the location is intended for *(mostly tables for 4 people)*

     **Valid From** and **Valid To**: Location validity. Chairs may not be available for the entire duration of the event, e.g. some areas may only be available on the first day of the event.


## ✏️ Editing Form
- **Name** - Name of the Event, it is used in many places *(Information emails, headlines in the frontend, etc.)*

- 🚧 *Max Persons - Currently unused*
- 🚧 *Max per Company - Not used at the moment*
- 🚧 *External URL - Not in use at the moment*
- **Timezone** - Time zone of the country in which the Event will take place
- **Status** - *(When setting up, leave "In preparation", as soon as everything is set, it is possible to switch to "Published")*

- **Mail Template From** - "Default template" - creates a default email template for a new event. If you want to use templates from an older event that was created earlier, you can select it and after saving the form, the templates will be copied.

- *👁 Created* - The date the record was created
- *👁 Modified* - The date the record was last edited
- *👁 Slug* - Unique page identifier, used in url addresses

You can track how many people have already passed or are yet to pass through Check-in. How many people are participating in the subevent. Or easily find out whether a specific person has already arrived or not.
