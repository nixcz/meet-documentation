This module only has an editing form, in which you can modify the basic settings of the application such as SMTP accesses, email addresses through which MEET will communicate, etc.

## ✏️ Editing Form

- **Test email recipient** - email address to which all test emails will be sent
- **SMTP sender address** - email address of the sender, which will be filled in for every message sent by the MEET application
- **Enable periodic sending** - turning on the automatic sending of the email message queue

**SMTP server settings:**
> [!NOTE] 
>**SMTP** *(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)* is a protocol used to transfer e-mail over the Internet. In order to send e-mails using SMTP, you need to fill in some of the following information.
- **SMTP host** - name of the server or IP address that will process requests to send email
- **SMTP port number** - most often 25 or 587
- **SMTP Username** - username for authentication, associated with the email account under which messages will be sent
- **SMTP Password** - access password associated with the username to verify the identity trying to send the email
- **Show password** - when checked, the saved password will be displayed once
- **SMTP TLS** *(Transport Layer Security)* Encryption protocol, ensuring secure communication between client and server. Data is encrypted, this increases security

## 💎 Function buttons
- **Save Test Email** - This button is used to send a test email to verify whether the SMTP settings are correct and whether communication with the mail server was successful.
